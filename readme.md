# About Me

Hi, I'm Thomas Delany,

I‚Äôm a Salesforce full-stack developer with hands-on experience in designing and building robust web applications and CRM integrations. On the backend, I specialize in PHP with Laravel, creating scalable APIs and efficient data workflows. On the frontend, I develop modern, responsive interfaces using JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. In the Salesforce ecosystem, I build custom business logic using Apex, design dynamic user experiences with Lightning Web Components (LWC), and work confidently with SOQL and SOSL to handle complex data requirements. I‚Äôm actively expanding my Salesforce skill set with real-world development experience and am on the path toward Platform Developer I certification.

## Check Out My Work

- https://github.com/Thomas-Delany/salesforce-customer-support - I am currently building a Salesforce DX project that serves as the backend for a Customer Support Portal. It allows support agents to view, manage, 
  and resolve cases submitted from an external Laravel frontend via Salesforce's REST API.
- Anglossa Project ‚Äì anglossa.com | es.anglossa.com |
  My most ambitious and evolving creation to date‚Äîa comprehensive English learning platform designed to assist learners worldwide. As the founder and lead developer, I built and continue to expand the Anglossa Project using Laravel, PHP, and Bootstrap, ensuring a seamless    and interactive learning experience. Previously operating under the EnglisReservoir brand, I‚Äôve since rebranded‚Äîall legacy domains (except .co.uk) now redirect to Anglossa.
- I completed https://www.englishreservoir.es/ which was built using PHP, Laravel, JavaScript and Bootstrap. This was done as part of a migration away from 
  WordPress.
- A now completed template website built using Bootstrap and PHP: https://englishreservoir.co.uk/ - This project was the first iteration before the 
  much-needed improvement using Laravel above ^^. Even though the code is a little messy, this project was my chance to deploy my site without a framework, 
  just using raw code.  
- A submodule repo I was working on to centrally control all my domain-specific repos. Check it out: https://github.com/Thomas-Delany/shared-components-ER. 
  However, this project has since been moved to Laravel in a private repo where I can work in a much more modular and professional environment. 
- The project I was working on with React and TailWind before I took it private: https://github.com/Thomas-Delany/Subdomain-with-React - This project has 
  also been moved to a private repo due to the project's current evolution. Once completed, this app will be deployed as a mobile application and site. 
- My main page built with WordPress: [English Reservoir](https://www.englishreservoir.com/) üåê - I am currently in the migration phase for this site, and it 
  will be moved to Laravel very soon!
- My YouTube channel for Spanish speakers: https://www.youtube.com/@Anglossa-ES 
- My YouTube channel for all others: https://www.youtube.com/@Anglossa 
- My Mars Rover Mission once mars has been colonized, which has been deployed at: https://lightgoldenrodyellow-kingfisher-429222.hostingersite.com/ + public 
  repo here: https://github.com/Thomas-Delany/mars-rover-mission - This project was part of a job application process, and was done using PHP, Laravel, 
  JavaScript and Bootstrap.
