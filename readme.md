# About Me

Hi, I'm Thomas Delany,

Backend Alchemist conjuring robust and scalable web experiences with PHP & Laravel. On the Frontend Frontier, I wield JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, and Tailwind to craft captivating user interfaces. My digital playground? The mighty Linux!

## Check Out My Work

- I completed https://www.englishreservoir.es/ which was built using PHP, Laravel, JavaScript and Bootstrap. This was done as part of a migration away from 
  WordPress.
- A now completed template website built using Bootstrap and PHP: https://englishreservoir.co.uk/ - This project was the first iteration before the 
  much-needed improvement using Laravel above ^^. Even though the code is a little messy, this project was my chance to deploy my site without a framework, 
  just using raw code.  
- A submodule repo I was working on to centrally control all my domain-specific repos. Check it out: https://github.com/Thomas-Delany/shared-components-ER. 
  However, this project has since been moved to Laravel in a private repo where I can work in a much more modular and professional environment. 
- The project I was working on with React and TailWind before I took it private: https://github.com/Thomas-Delany/Subdomain-with-React - This project has 
  also been moved to a private repo due to the project's current evolution. Once completed, this app will be deployed as a mobile application and site. 
- My main page built with WordPress: [English Reservoir](https://www.englishreservoir.com/) üåê - I am currently in the migration phase for this site, and it 
  will be moved to Laravel very soon!

- My Mars Rover Mission once mars has been colonized, which has been deployed at: https://lightgoldenrodyellow-kingfisher-429222.hostingersite.com/ + public 
  repo here: https://github.com/Thomas-Delany/mars-rover-mission - This project was part of a job application process, and was done using PHP, Laravel, 
  JavaScript and Bootstrap.
